		<h3><b>Project Category: </b>Game</h3>

		My game is to control the character to go through the almost unpassable maze and reach to the destination before the time runs out. However, the player has the option to refresh the maze, so it will be reformed randomly until it becomes passable. <br>
		<br>
		The maze should be formed by a grid format. There should be squares that serves the blocking function, so the player cannot pass through. When the player hits the refresh maze button, the blocks to be reassigned a random position on the grid (avoiding other blocks or the player's current position). <br>

		<br>
		At the same time once the player starts moving, the timer should start. Once the timer (a bird) reaches from the start to end (sun to moon), it signifies the end of the game, so a game over text should show up.<br>
		<br>
		The player should control its character (red circle) through the grid maze while refreshing the formation of the blocks whenever the player got stuck.<br>

		<br>
		As you can see, I created the game assets accordingly to a grid (100 x 100 px on image right now, but i will reduce all size by half so it'll be 50 x 50 px). So it should be able to help me get the positioning of the assets easier later.<br>
		<br>
		Oh... I think I really need some music to go along with it?

		<h3>Game Inspirations:</h3>
		<br>
		My main game inspiration came from many games that actually made me interested in re-playing them. Including the famous minesweeper, which it's randomnized values made the game unpredictable. <br>

		<br>
		<br>
		The inspiration also came from a in-game puzzle from a pc game "Undertale". The in-game puzzle was never really focused in the game but more as a contributing factor of the plot, but I find that concept amazing enough. <br>

		<br>
		<br>
		<h3>Style Inspirations:</h3>
		<br>
		The design and art of the assets done in the game are inspired from the overall style of games from the website Orisinal. The website features 62 Flash games created by Ferry Halim, and I remembered playing games from there since many years ago. I believed what attracted me to play the games are not only because of the gameplay, but also the cute artstyle. The colors are soft and subtle. I want to incorporate the similar feelings of the art style.<br>
