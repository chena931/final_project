		<h3></b>Project Name: </b>Eat the Most. (100% Most likely would be chagned)</h3>
		<b>Project Category: </b>Game
		<br>

		My game is to control the character to go through the maze to collect food. The maze should be formed by a grid and squares of different colors. The different colors (randomly generated) should each have a different rule. Some cannot be walked on, some can only be walked on once, and the rest having differen't score values.
		<br>
		The goal of this game is to collected the highest score during one runthough of the maze.
		<br>
		Since the maze should be randomly generated, the player should be able to get an option to refresh their game at all times.

		<b>Game Inspirations:</b>
		<br>
		My main game inspiration came from many games that actually made me interested in re-playing them. Including the famous minesweeper, which it's randomnized values made the game unpredictable. <br>

		The inspiration also came from a in-game puzzle from a pc game Undertale. The in-game puzzle was never really focused in the game but more as a contributing factor of the plot, but I find that concept amazing enough. <br>
